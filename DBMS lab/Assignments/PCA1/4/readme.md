1. An insurance agent sells insurance policies to its clients. Policies can be of different types such as vehicle insurance, life insurance, accident insurance,
postal insurance etc. The agent collects monthly, quarterly or yearly premiums from its clients in the form of cheques from local banks. Clients may also pay premiums
online and avail a rebate. In this case the agent does not get his commission. If renewals are not done by the expiry date the clients are charged a fine. At the time
of maturity, the sum assured from the policy is transferred to the client either via cheque handed over by the agent or via NEFT to the client's savings account. In
case of death of the client, the nominee gets the sum assured.
