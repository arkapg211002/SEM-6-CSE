1. Suppose you are given the following requirements for a simple database for the National Hockey League (NHL). The NHL has many teams. Each team has a unique
identifier, name, a city, a coach, a captain, and a set of players. Each player belongs to only one team. Each player has a jersey number, name, a position (such as
left wing or goalie), a skill level, and a set of injury records. A team captain is also a player. A game is played between two teams (referred to as host team and
guest team) and has a date of play (such as May 11th,1999) and points scored (2 for each win, 1 for draw and 0 for loss) on the points table.

a) Draw an ER diagram for the above problem and use EER concepts in your diagram.
b) Map the ER diagram into a relational model.
c) State the assumptions you make.
