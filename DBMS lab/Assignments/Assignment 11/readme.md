A record company wishes to use a computer database to help with its operations regarding its performers,
recordings and song catalogue.

A requirements analysis has elicited the following information:

Songs have a unique song number, a non-unique title and a composition date.
A song can be written by a number of composers; the composer’s full name is required.
Songs are recorded by recording artists (bands or solo performers).
A song is recorded as a track of a CD.
A CD has many songs on it, called tracks.
CDs have a unique record catalogue number, a title and must have a producer(the full name of the producer is required).
Each track must have the recording date and the track number of the CD.
• A song can appear on many (or no) CDs,  and be recorded by many different recording artists.
The same recording artist might re-record the same song on different CDs.
A CD must have only 1 recording artist appearing on it.
CDs can be released a number of times, and each time the release date and associated number of sales is required.

1.Use this information to design an appropriate ER and relational model.

2.Compile DDL and DML commands on the database created.
SQL:- i>Update number of recorded album to 4 for those artist who has recorded only 3.
      ii>Find all artists who have recorded at least two albums.
      iii>Find all writers who have only written one song.
PL/SQL
