[Table:  AREAS (RADIUS, AREA)].

iv.Implement a PL/SQL procedure that takes weight of an apple box as input from the user. If the weight is >= 10 kg, rate =Rs. 5/kg. If weight is < 10 kg, rate = Rs. 7/kg. Calculate the cost of the apple box. Display the output on the screen.

v.Implement a PL/SQL procedure to calculate the difference between highest salaried and lowest salaried employee. Store the information in a table.

vi.Implement a PL/SQL block using cursor that will display the name, department and the salary of the first 3 employees getting lowest salary.
