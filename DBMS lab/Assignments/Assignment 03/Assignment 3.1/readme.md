#### Consider the following database scenario for a hospital. Hospital staff consist of doctors and nurses. Each hospital staff has a staff id, name (first name, middle name, and last name), and phone numbers. Doctors have an office and up to 3 specializations. Doctors have nurses that work with/assist them. Each nurse has one specialization and belongs to a specific department in the hospital. All nurses work with doctors. Many nurses can work with one doctor. Doctors sometimes consult with a colleague (who is another doctor). Doctors treat patients. Patient information collected by the hospital consists of patient ID, name, insurance, date of admission, and checked out date. A patient can undergo a number of tests. Doctors perform tests. Each test has a unique ID, name, a result, and a date and time the test was performed.
