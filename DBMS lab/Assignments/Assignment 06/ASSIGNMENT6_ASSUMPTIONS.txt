ASSUMPTIONS
1. A Customer can own more than one car. This indicates a one-to-many relationship between the `CUSTOMER` entity and the `CAR` entity, established by the `CID` attribute in the `CAR` table, which serves as a foreign key referencing the `CID` attribute in the `CUSTOMER` table.
2. A car can be owned by one customer at a time. This reflects the one-to-many relationship between the `CUSTOMER` entity and the `CAR` entity, enforced by the `CID` attribute in the `CAR` table, which references the `CID` attribute in the `CUSTOMER` table.
3. A car can have multiple accidents. This indicates a one-to-many relationship between the `CAR` entity and the `ACCIDENT` entity, represented by the `LNO` attribute in the `ACCIDENT` table, which acts as a foreign key referencing the `LNO` attribute in the `CAR` table.
4. For a particular accident, the record number is allotted for one car only. This reflects a one-to-one relationship between the `ACCIDENT` entity and the `CAR` entity, with each accident entity associated with only one car entity.This is enforced by the `LNO` attribute in the `ACCIDENT` table, which acts as a foreign key referencing the `LNO` attribute in the `CAR` table. The `RNO` attribute in the `ACCIDENT` table serves as the primary key, uniquely identifying each accident record.
5. A car can be comprehensive or third party depending on the type of insurance it has. This implies a classification of cars based on their insurance type, with two subtypes: Comprehensive Car and Third-Party Car. The ER diagram can represent this using the subtype-supertype relationship feature, where `CAR` is the supertype entity and `Comprehensive_Car` and `Third_Party_Car` are the subtypes. The subtype entities (`Comprehensive_Car` and `Third_Party_Car`) are associated with the `CAR` entity through foreign key constraints. Subtype-specific attributes (`INSURANCE_TYPE` for both subtypes) differentiate between them.
