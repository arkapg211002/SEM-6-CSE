i.Design an ER diagram for an application that models a car-insurance company whose customers own one or more cars each.
Analyze the requirements by identifying the entities, attributes, relationships, keys, constraints etc.
Apply extended entity-relationship features to the design. Defend your design with proper assumptions and justifications. Map the ER model into a relational model.

ii.Create  tables,  populate  with  data  and  construct  queries  (advanced)  in  SQL  to  extract information from the car insurance company’s database.
Consider a car-insurance company whose customers own one or more cars each. Each car has associated with it zero to any number of recorded accidents.

iii.Enter at least 5 sets of records in each table form created in part (ii).

a.Find the total number of people who owned cars that were involved in accidents in 2010.
