#### Demonstration of data transmission using FTP and HTTP protocols and network traffic using wireshark or tcpdump

To create your own FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server, you can use various software packages available for different operating systems. Here, I'll outline the general steps to set up an FTP server on Linux using `vsftpd` (Very Secure FTP Daemon), which is a popular choice due to its simplicity and security features. This guide assumes you are using a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu or CentOS), but similar concepts apply to other platforms with different FTP server software.

Works locally but not from other machine

### Step 1: Install `vsftpd`

1. Update your package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update  # For Ubuntu/Debian
   ```

2. Install `vsftpd`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install vsftpd  # For Ubuntu/Debian
   ```

### Step 2: Configure `vsftpd`

```
# Original File

# Example config file /etc/vsftpd.conf
#
# The default compiled in settings are fairly paranoid. This sample file
# loosens things up a bit, to make the ftp daemon more usable.
# Please see vsftpd.conf.5 for all compiled in defaults.
#
# READ THIS: This example file is NOT an exhaustive list of vsftpd options.
# Please read the vsftpd.conf.5 manual page to get a full idea of vsftpd's
# capabilities.
#
#
# Run standalone?  vsftpd can run either from an inetd or as a standalone
# daemon started from an initscript.
listen=NO
#
# This directive enables listening on IPv6 sockets. By default, listening
# on the IPv6 "any" address (::) will accept connections from both IPv6
# and IPv4 clients. It is not necessary to listen on *both* IPv4 and IPv6
# sockets. If you want that (perhaps because you want to listen on specific
# addresses) then you must run two copies of vsftpd with two configuration
# files.
listen_ipv6=YES
#
# Allow anonymous FTP? (Disabled by default).
anonymous_enable=NO
#
# Uncomment this to allow local users to log in.
local_enable=YES
#
# Uncomment this to enable any form of FTP write command.
#write_enable=YES
#
# Default umask for local users is 077. You may wish to change this to 022,
# if your users expect that (022 is used by most other ftpd's)
#local_umask=022
#
# Uncomment this to allow the anonymous FTP user to upload files. This only
# has an effect if the above global write enable is activated. Also, you will
# obviously need to create a directory writable by the FTP user.
#anon_upload_enable=YES
#
# Uncomment this if you want the anonymous FTP user to be able to create
# new directories.
#anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES
#
# Activate directory messages - messages given to remote users when they
# go into a certain directory.
dirmessage_enable=YES
#
# If enabled, vsftpd will display directory listings with the time
# in  your  local  time  zone.  The default is to display GMT. The
# times returned by the MDTM FTP command are also affected by this
# option.
use_localtime=YES
#
# Activate logging of uploads/downloads.
xferlog_enable=YES
#
# Make sure PORT transfer connections originate from port 20 (ftp-data).
connect_from_port_20=YES
#
# If you want, you can arrange for uploaded anonymous files to be owned by
# a different user. Note! Using "root" for uploaded files is not
# recommended!
#chown_uploads=YES
#chown_username=whoever
#
# You may override where the log file goes if you like. The default is shown
# below.
#xferlog_file=/var/log/vsftpd.log
#
# If you want, you can have your log file in standard ftpd xferlog format.
# Note that the default log file location is /var/log/xferlog in this case.
#xferlog_std_format=YES
#
# You may change the default value for timing out an idle session.
#idle_session_timeout=600
#
# You may change the default value for timing out a data connection.
#data_connection_timeout=120
#
# It is recommended that you define on your system a unique user which the
# ftp server can use as a totally isolated and unprivileged user.
#nopriv_user=ftpsecure
#
# Enable this and the server will recognise asynchronous ABOR requests. Not
# recommended for security (the code is non-trivial). Not enabling it,
# however, may confuse older FTP clients.
#async_abor_enable=YES
#
# By default the server will pretend to allow ASCII mode but in fact ignore
# the request. Turn on the below options to have the server actually do ASCII
# mangling on files when in ASCII mode.
# Beware that on some FTP servers, ASCII support allows a denial of service
# attack (DoS) via the command "SIZE /big/file" in ASCII mode. vsftpd
# predicted this attack and has always been safe, reporting the size of the
# raw file.
# ASCII mangling is a horrible feature of the protocol.
#ascii_upload_enable=YES
#ascii_download_enable=YES
#
# You may fully customise the login banner string:
#ftpd_banner=Welcome to blah FTP service.
#
# You may specify a file of disallowed anonymous e-mail addresses. Apparently
# useful for combatting certain DoS attacks.
#deny_email_enable=YES
# (default follows)
#banned_email_file=/etc/vsftpd.banned_emails
#
# You may restrict local users to their home directories.  See the FAQ for
# the possible risks in this before using chroot_local_user or
# chroot_list_enable below.
#chroot_local_user=YES
#
# You may specify an explicit list of local users to chroot() to their home
# directory. If chroot_local_user is YES, then this list becomes a list of
# users to NOT chroot().
# (Warning! chroot'ing can be very dangerous. If using chroot, make sure that
# the user does not have write access to the top level directory within the
# chroot)
#chroot_local_user=YES
#chroot_list_enable=YES
# (default follows)
#chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list
#
# You may activate the "-R" option to the builtin ls. This is disabled by
# default to avoid remote users being able to cause excessive I/O on large
# sites. However, some broken FTP clients such as "ncftp" and "mirror" assume
# the presence of the "-R" option, so there is a strong case for enabling it.
#ls_recurse_enable=YES
#
# Customization
#
# Some of vsftpd's settings don't fit the filesystem layout by
# default.
#
# This option should be the name of a directory which is empty.  Also, the
# directory should not be writable by the ftp user. This directory is used
# as a secure chroot() jail at times vsftpd does not require filesystem
# access.
secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty
#
# This string is the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use.
pam_service_name=vsftpd
#
# This option specifies the location of the RSA certificate to use for SSL
# encrypted connections.
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
ssl_enable=NO

#
# Uncomment this to indicate that vsftpd use a utf8 filesystem.
#utf8_filesystem=YES

```

1. Edit the `vsftpd` configuration file (`/etc/vsftpd.conf`):
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
   ```

2. Configure `vsftpd` based on your requirements. Here are some common settings:

   - Enable anonymous FTP (optional):
     ```
     anonymous_enable=YES
     ```
   
   - Disable anonymous FTP (recommended for security):
     ```
     anonymous_enable=NO
     ```

   - Allow local users to login (recommended):
     ```
     local_enable=YES
     ```

   - Set the directory for FTP users (e.g., `/home/ftp`):
     ```
     local_root=/home/ftp
     ```

   - Enable write access for local users (use with caution):
     ```
     write_enable=YES
     ```

   - Allow FTP passive mode for firewall compatibility:
     ```
     pasv_enable=YES
     pasv_min_port=40000
     pasv_max_port=40100
     ```

   - Configure user-specific settings (e.g., limit to specific users):
     ```
     user_config_dir=/etc/vsftpd/user_conf
     ```

   Save and exit (`Ctrl+X`, `Y`, `Enter`).

user_config_dir=/etc/vsftpd/user_config_dir
```

### Step 3: Create FTP User Accounts (if needed)

1. Create a system user for FTP (e.g., `ftpuser`):
   ```bash
   sudo adduser ftpuser
   ```

2. Set a password for the user:
   ```bash
   sudo passwd ftpuser
   ```

### Step 4: Start and Enable `vsftpd`

1. Start the `vsftpd` service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start vsftpd
   ```

2. Enable `vsftpd` to start on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable vsftpd
   ```

### Step 5: Configure Firewall (if applicable)

If you have a firewall enabled (e.g., `ufw` on Ubuntu), allow FTP traffic on port 21 (and passive mode ports if configured):
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 21/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 40000:40100/tcp  # Example for passive mode ports
   ```

### Step 6: Test the FTP Server

1. Use an FTP client (e.g., FileZilla, command-line `ftp`) to connect to your server using the IP address or domain name.

2. Log in with the FTP username and password you created.

3. Upload, download, and manage files using the FTP client.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Security**: Always ensure your FTP server is configured securely. Consider using SSL/TLS encryption for FTP (FTPS) or use SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) for more secure file transfers.
  
- **User Management**: Manage FTP user accounts and permissions carefully to restrict access and prevent unauthorized access.

- **Logging**: Enable logging (`xferlog_enable=YES` in `vsftpd.conf`) to monitor FTP activities.

- **Firewall**: Configure your firewall to allow FTP traffic on the necessary ports.

This guide provides a basic setup for creating an FTP server using `vsftpd`. Depending on your specific requirements and environment, you may need to customize the configuration further. Additionally, consider exploring other FTP server software options based on your preferences and operating system.
